# DIM-Project-Website


This repository contains the Html, CSS and JS code that will be used for my Digital Interactive Media Module for my University Studies. The website itself is based on Climate Change and is aimed to teach key stage four audiences about climate change and the important changes that it will bring to the world and how it could be prevented, furthermore the website will contain information about the effects that Humans are having on climate change and showcase some them and show the audience about the problems we cause for climate change.
