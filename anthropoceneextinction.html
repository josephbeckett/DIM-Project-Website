                is used in hundreds of products, main food products but because it makes money and its cheap, they
                continue to cut down the forest and kill orangutans

                Japan has recently just announced that it is going to continue commercial whaling which was banned by
                the IWC (International Whaling Commission) but Japan, Iceland and Norway are countries that wish to lift
                the ban for certain stocks, but animal rights activists disagree with this and intent that the ban
                should say and it should because like any other animal, once you start to remove them the eco system
                begins to collapse the amount of greed that humanity is capable of is blinding.
                The Process involves firing harpoons into the whales and pulling them up the side of the boat and letting them bleed out and die
                and then they are gutted like any other fish and used for delicacies in Japan and other asian countries

                Shark Fishing should always be banned because sharks are a vital part of the oceanic eco system, and
                without them the eco system would collapse. Now Shark fishing mainly occurs in Asian countries because
                they kill them for their fins that are used in shark fin soup. The process at which they kill the
                animals is just cruel. They Start but using fishing line to hook the sharks, and the cut the fins off
                and chuck the rest of the fish back into the water, and the authorities in Japan and China both deny
                that this happens but their video proof of it. Furthermore, because sharks need fins to swim and push
                air through their gill to breath they suffocate at the bottom of the ocean.

            <p class="humancauses-section-text">Plastic pollution is only now becoming major news, ever since David
                Attenborough’s Planet Earth 2 companies have been trying to change from using plastic to paper and other
                biodegradable materials. Personally as good as an effort it is, it’s not enough to reduce the amount of
                plastic that’s already out there, we need to start removing the plastic in the oceans and reducing the
                amount of rubbish that is sent to landfill sites and start recycling properly and not just shipping it
                off to china where it sits in dumps for nothing. We need to start focussing cutting down the problem at
                its source.
